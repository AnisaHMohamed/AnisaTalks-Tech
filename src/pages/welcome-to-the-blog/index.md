  > "Anisa Mohamed was one of the young women who received a certificate of recognition for their work. Mohamed has organized after-school programs, backpack giveaways and barbecues in her community to counteract the fear and isolation created by a series of shootings in her neighbourhood.
  > When I was growing up, we were outside playing and hanging out on our bikes," she said. "And it's just different now. You can't come outside, you can't walk home. There's just a sense of fear."

 > Her programs create "a sense of family and community, and everyone really feels like they know each other again.

 > "It creates really a sense of oneness that we were missing because of the violence."

 > Luttenberger said it was "amazing" to meet so many people dedicated to helping others.

 > "They don't want to sit back and talk about things," she said. "They want to make things happen.""
